- Sampler Support for last full minute
- Sampler Support for rolling last hour
- Better VARZOpCmdParse
- Better internal documentation
- New variable type: String value
- Experiment with other event handling mechanics (ex: libevent)

DONE:
- fuzzers
- Global Created time (IE: time since last flush), needed for all time rates for counters/samplers
